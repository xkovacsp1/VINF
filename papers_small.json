		"abstract": "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1).

Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts.

The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations.

We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n",

Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n",

		"abstract": "  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n",

In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy.

The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n",

		"abstract": "  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

A difficult problem of AE analysis is\nseparation and characterization of signal components when the signals from\nvarious sources and the mode of mixing are unknown.

The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",

		"abstract": "  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles\ntheory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n",

		"abstract": "  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf\nsecondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\nbroadening, $V_{\\rm rot} \\sin i_{\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary\nradius of $R_{\\rm A} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to\nthe radius of the secondary, $R_{\\rm B} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the\nsemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU.\nOur single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the\nindividual masses, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A} = 1.04\n\\pm 0.13$ \\msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical\nmass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity\nto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.\n",

		"abstract": "  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory\nof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical\nview-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\nof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg\nequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is\nsolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal\nordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\nmean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the\nonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not\ncontradict to the existing data.\n",

Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\n",

		"abstract": "  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\n",

		"abstract": "  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n",

We apply the\ninverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The\nresulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under\nvanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit\nmanner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into\ntwo kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies\nthe ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the\npolar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton\ncollisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a\ncollision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the\nprevious studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and\ndark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of\nthe multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.\n",

		"abstract": "  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of\nclustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n",

		"abstract": "  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n",

In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict\na future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor\nerror is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is\nexpressed by the mean square distance between data points.

		"abstract": "  Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA\nmethod in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively\nsmall number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of\nstatistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of\nmaximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system\nlimit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading\nmatrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a\ncomparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.\n",

		"abstract": "  For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the\ninequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \\ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \\le\n||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative\noperator monotone $f$ on $[0,\\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These\ninequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave\nfunctions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,\nand Kosem, respectively.\n  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||\nf(A)-f(B) ||| \\le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \\ge ||| g(|A-B|)\n|||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a\nsimilar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer\nexactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively\nin the special case when $A\\ge ||B||$.\n  In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated\nmajorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself\na Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows\nto strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.\n",

		"abstract": "  The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms\nof the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be\nunderstood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain\nconstraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n\nkinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii)\nHandles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black\nhandles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an\nexterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is\nshown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from\nthat with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat\nspace-times.\n",
